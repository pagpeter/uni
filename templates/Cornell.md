- # Notes
<aside>Note's Layout</aside>

- **Cue/Question Column (Left)** — is used to write down questions, keywords, or cues related to the content you're recording in the main notes section.
- **Note-taking Column (Right)** — here you write your main notes during the lecture or reading. This section should contain the most critical information, main ideas, supporting details, and explanations.
- **Summary Section (Bottom)** — here you write a concise summary of the main points covered in your notes.


* Start by listening or reading actively, and jot down the main ideas and supporting details in the Note-taking Column.
* Use abbreviations and bullet points to keep your notes concise and easy to review.
* In the Cue/Question Column, write down questions or cues that correspond to the material you're noting in the right column. These questions can be used as study prompts later.
* If you come across concepts or ideas that you don't understand fully, make a note of it and try to clarify them later through research or by asking your instructor.

<aside>Review and Study</aside>

* After the lecture or reading, review your notes as soon as possible to reinforce the information in your memory.
* Use the Cue/Question Column to cover the right-hand side of your notes and quiz yourself based on the cues or questions you wrote down.
* Reflect on the material and try to answer the questions from memory. This active recall helps improve retention.
* Check your answers and understanding in the Note-taking Column and fill in any gaps or correct any mistakes in your summary section.
